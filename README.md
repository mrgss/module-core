# MRGSS
Cross Platform MRUBY game Library.
Fill the world with the power of ruby!

## What is this?
This is a library aiming to fast game development in mruby, but at the same time archieving a 
really good performance on its own.

This gem aims to combine the flexibility of ruby plus the speed of openGL.

Also, this gem works as little modules you will add, so this is only for core functionality 
and the library than coordinates the rest
